            DoorList is a <b>social media app</b> designed for college students to engage in groups, chat with friends, and attend events. It is a <b>published app</b> on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store with over <b>10,000 registered users</b>. I was brought in as a <b>UX designer and prototyper</b>, in a larger design team, to focus on improving three things:<br>
            <br>
            1. The <b>onboarding process</b><br>
            2. The <b>explore and groups page</b><br>
            3. <b>Engagement</b> with in-app <b>group features</b><br>
            <br>
            <b>Collaboration</b> was very important in this project. My colleagues focused more on user research and synthesis, and I worked closely with them to discuss their insights and implement their ideas. <br>
            <br>
            I used <b>Figma</b> to design <b>lo-fi, mid-fi, and hi-fi wireframes</b>, and to create the <b>final prototype</b>. For the research phase, we utilized <b>design thinking</b> to analyze <b>user pain points</b> and find potential solutions. During the design phase, we focused on <b>agile development</b> due to our client’s fast-moving product and changing desires. We held a constant <b>dialogue</b> within the team and with the clients to effectively address issues and meet milestones efficiently. <br>
            <br>
            In the end, we made a <b>complete redesign</b> of the <b>onboarding process</b> to make it faster, simpler, and more tailored to user preferences. We modified the <b>explore</b> and <b>groups page layouts</b> to highlight the group features and encourage social interaction. Finally, we designed a <b>passport feature</b> with badges to incentive user engagement with the group features within the app.
        </div>
        <br><br><br>
        <div class = "header" id = "II">II. Research & Ideation</div>
        <div class = "text">
            <br>
            After initial exploration, we quickly defined a few research focus areas:<br>
            <br>
            • <b>Feature Enhancements</b>: Changing the explore and groups page to ensure accessibility and usability<br>
            • <b>Redundant and Complicated Features</b>: Remove repetitive or unnecessary elements like the dashboard, streamline search tabs, and ensure all features serve a clear purpose<br>
            • <b>Group Dynamics</b>: Improve the visibility of group features to attract interest<br>
            <br>
            Our target audience was <b>college students</b>–specifically students looking to join or already in social groups. With this, we decided to conduct <b>user surveys</b>, asking current users of the app what improvements they would like to see. The main insights we gathered from responses were:<br>
            <br>
            • It is hard to find events to attend within the app<br>
            • Groups don’t seem to serve much purpose<br>
            <br>
            Next, we looked at a few <b>market competitors</b>, and analyzed their <b>strengths and weaknesses</b>. This helped us gain initial ideas for what works and what doesn’t.<br>
            <br>
            • <b>Flare</b>: Mainly greek life college students, similar groups and photo sharing features<br>
            • <b>Poppin</b>: Mainly for college parties, similar color theme and style<br>
            • <b>Partiful</b>: Mainly for parties, stamps system<br>
            <br>
            After that, we developed <b>user personas</b> to try and fully understand the <b>desires</b> and <b>frustrations</b> of potential users of the app.<br>
            <br>
            <div class = "imagePlaceholder" style = "padding-top:56%;">
                <img class = "image" src="doorlist/doorlist1.png">
            </div>
            <br>
            <span class = "caption">3 User Personas we made.</span><br>
            <br>
            The next stage was ideation. We got together and spent a fair amount of time brainstorming, discussing, and working through potential ideas to solve the issues identified during the research.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Friends</b><br>
            • See the events your friends are going to<br>
            • See what groups friends are in<br>
            <br>
            <b>Photo Sharing</b><br>
            • Use photo sharing as a way for groups to “create an image”<br>
            • Feature on public group page<br>
            <br>
            <b>Explore Page</b><br>
            • Be able to search groups, events, and users<br>
            • Filter for event/group categories<br>
            • Personalized group and event recommendations<br>
            <br>
            <b>Groups</b><br>
            • Make the landing page more enticing<br>
            • Have public and private groups to populate the app<br>
            <br>
            <b>Passport</b><br>
            • Fits overall social theme<br>
            • Keep track of events you went to or hosted within the app<br>
            • Creates competition within the app to engage users<br>
        </div>
        <br><br><br>
        <div class = "header" id = "III">III. Wireframes</div>
        <div class = "text">
            <br>
            First, I started with <b>low fidelity</b> wireframes of the <b>onboarding pages</b>.<br>
            <br>
            <div class = "imagePlaceholder" style = "padding-top:50%;">
                <img class = "image" src="doorlist/doorlist2.png">
            </div>
            <br>
            <span class = "caption">Lo-fi wireframes of the onboarding pages.</span><br>
            <br>
            One key element of this design is to get the minimum amount of basic details from the user to make the process as <b>easy</b> and <b>simple</b> as possible. Another important aspect is giving <b>initial recommendations</b> of groups to join, because based on our research, we wanted users to join more groups.<br>
            <br>
            Next, I made a lo-fi wireframe for an initial concept of an <b>explore page</b>.<br>
            <br>
            <div class = "imagePlaceholder" style = "padding-top:76%;">
                <img class = "image" src="doorlist/doorlist3.png">
            </div>
            <br>
            <span class = "caption">Lo-fi wireframe of an explore page.</span><br>
            <br>
            From the research, we wanted to allow users to easily <b>search for, filter through, and discover groups</b> on this page, which is illustrated in this simple concept with a clear search bar, filter button, and list of groups to explore.<br>
            <br>
            Finally, I created lo-fi wireframes for the new <b>groups page</b>.<br>
            <br>
            <div class = "imagePlaceholder" style = "padding-top:60%;">
                <img class = "image" src="doorlist/doorlist4.png">
            </div>
            <br>
            <span class = "caption">Lo-fi wireframes of the groups page.</span><br>
            <br>
            We wanted to highlight <b>group photos</b> more prominently on the groups page, and to overall simplify it to make the important information easier to find.<br>
            <br>
            The <b>main takeaways</b> we got from these wireframes were:<br>
            • The explore page should have <b>more content and features</b> on it to increase <b>engagement</b><br>
            • Customizing the app based on <b>user interests</b> is important<br>
            • Because it is a social app, the main focus is always on <b>people</b> themselves<br>
            <br>
            After this, I made a batch of <b>mid fidelity</b> wireframes for the same concepts, taking into account our lo-fi insights.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Onboarding pages</b>:<br>
            <br>
            <div class = "imagePlaceholder" style = "padding-top:68%;">
                <img class = "image" src="doorlist/doorlist5.png">
            </div>
            <br>
            <span class = "caption">Mid-fi wireframes of the onboarding pages.</span><br>
            <br>
            I added a new page where the user can select specific <b>interest categories</b>, which will then later get recommended to them on the explore page in the form of groups and events to join.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Explore page</b>:<br>
            <br>
            <div class = "imagePlaceholder" style = "padding-top:85%;">
                <img class = "image" src="doorlist/doorlist6.png" >
            </div>
            <br>
            <span class = "caption">Mid-fi wireframe of the explore page.</span><br>
            <br>
            I created a more extensive layout for this page, breaking it up into <b>5 main sections</b>: the search bar, recommended events, recommended groups, trending events, and recommended friends. This provides much more interactable content and makes use of the in-app features.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Group page</b>:<br>
            <br>
            <div class = "imagePlaceholder" style = "padding-top:84%;">
                <img class = "image" src="doorlist/doorlist7.png">
            </div>
            <br>
            <span class = "caption">Mid-fi wireframes of the group page.</span><br>
            <br>
            This version prominently features <b>photos</b> at the top of the page, emphasizing the social aspect of the app.<br>
            <br>
            What we <b>learned</b> from this mid-fi process was:<br>
            • We wanted an additional feature to make users more <b>incentivized to use the app for events</b><br>
            • Filters were <b>not feasible</b> because, in this stage of the app, there are not enough public events for filters to be effective<br>
            • The <b>people/recommended friends</b> should be at the top of the explore page instead of the bottom, because they are the most important<br>
            • <b>Images</b> on the groups page is important, especially near the top<br>
        </div>
        <br><br><br>
        <div class = "header" id = "IV">IV. Final Prototype</div>
        <div class = "text">
            <br>
            We combined all of these ideas, insights, and feedback to make the <b>final, high-fidelity prototype</b>.<br>
            <br>
            <div class = "imagePlaceholder" style = "padding-top:75%;">
                <img class = "image" src="doorlist/doorlist8.png">
            </div>
            <br>
            <span class = "caption">Logo page.</span><br>
            <br>
            <div class = "imagePlaceholder" style = "padding-top:75%;">
                <img class = "image" src="doorlist/doorlist9.png">
            </div>
            <br>
            <span class = "caption">Onboarding pages.</span><br>
            <br>
            <div class = "imagePlaceholder" style = "padding-top:75%;">
                <img class = "image" src="doorlist/doorlist10.png">
            </div>
            <br>
            <span class = "caption">Explore page.</span><br>
            <br>
            <div class = "imagePlaceholder" style = "padding-top:75%;">
                <img class = "image" src="doorlist/doorlist11.png">
            </div>
            <br>
            <span class = "caption">Passport pages.</span><br>
            <br>
            <div class = "imagePlaceholder" style = "padding-top:75%;">
                <img class = "image" src="doorlist/doorlist12.png">
            </div>
            <br>
            <span class = "caption">Group page.</span><br>
            <br>
            Some <b>key parts</b> of these final designs:<br>
            • I made the <b>color theme</b> on the initial onboarding process more <b>vibrant</b> in order to have a good first impression for users<br>
            • On the explore page, we moved the <b>users section</b> to the top to highlight the importance of <b>connecting with other individuals</b><br>
            • Added <b>friend-recommended content</b> to the explore page, which is effective in convincing users to join<br>
            • For the groups page, we added a <b>full photo banner</b> at the top, along with the group profile picture and basic information<br>
            • Made the groups page more <b>organized and streamlined</b><br>
            • For the passport, we added <b>colorful badges</b> that serve as achievements based on how many events you have attended and hosted within the app<br>
            • It also shows <b>friends’ passports</b> on the same page, creating a <b>competition</b> within the app motivating users to engage more<br>
        </div>
        <br><br><br>
        <div class = "header">V. Outcomes</div>
        <div class = "text" id = "V">
            <br>
            Our project achieved the <b>three goals</b> initially set by our team and the client. We made the <b>onboarding process</b> easier and faster for users. The new <b>explore and groups page</b> use in-app features more effectively, provide recommendations, and highlight social aspects of the app. The <b>passport</b> design creates an incentive for users to engage with group and event features within the app.<br>
            <br>
            I learned a lot about <b>flexibility</b> in this project. We had numerous ideas and concepts throughout the process, and we ended up <b>pivoting</b> away from some of them to incorporate better ideas. It forced me and my team to be continually flexible and agile, in <b>constant communication</b> with each other and prepared to make significant changes at any point of the project. This was a <b>valuable opportunity</b> to improve my <b>wireframing, design, prototyping, and collaboration</b> skills.<br>
