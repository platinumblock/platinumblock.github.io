            The <b>Daly City Youth Health Center (DCYHC)</b> is a non-profit organization dedicated to providing their local community’s <b>low income</b> and <b>at-risk youth</b> ages 12-24 with <b>primary health care</b> at low or no cost. They serve over <b>3000 people</b> in Daly City, San Mateo, and the surrounding regions of northern California.<br>
            <br>
            I was brought in as a <b>UX designer</b>, in a team of two other designers, to focus on improving their <b>main external website</b>. My role was to do 3 main things:<br>
            <br>
            1. Conduct <b>user research</b> and <b>ideate</b> to find ways to improve the user experience of their website<br>
            2. <b>Design</b> a <b>new version</b> of their entire website that applies those solutions<br>
            3. Implement that design in their <b>official Squarespace website</b><br>
            <br>
            I <b>collaborated</b> with my teammates to discuss research, brainstorm ideas, and split up the work for the designing and implementation processes. We worked together in ensuring a consistent style and helpful changes throughout the website.<br>
            <br>
            I used <b>Figma</b> to design <b>lo-fi and hi-fi wireframes</b>, and <b>Squarespace</b> to implement the <b>final prototype</b>. During the research and ideation phase, we utilized <b>extensive internal testing</b> to find every little detail that could be improved. We also had frequent conversations with the organization to get feedback and new directions of research.<br>
            <br>
            At the end, we updated their official external website to be <b>easier</b> to use, more <b>visually consistent</b>, and more <b>accessible</b> for their low-income clients.<br>
        </div>
        <br><br><br>
        <div class = "header" id = "II">II. Research & Ideation</div>
        <div class = "text">
            <br>
            The bulk of our research was from <b>internal testing</b>, as the old website was already published and the organization wanted us to keep similar themes and information to <b>minimize the transition</b> for their clients. We spent extensive time going through every page of the website together, discussing our thoughts and brainstorming ideas.<br>
            <br>
            First, we started with the <b>home page</b>. After testing, we had some main takeaways:<br>
            <br>
            • The header is <b>confusing</b><br>
            • The page is very <b>long</b> and <b>unorganized</b><br>
            • There is some <b>redundant</b> information<br>
            • There is not much <b>call to action</b><br>
            • Some images are <b>low quality</b><br>
            • Several features <b>do not work</b><br>
            <br>
            From this, we developed <b>solutions</b>:<br>
            <br>
            • <b>Reduce</b> the number of links in the header<br>
            • <b>Reduce</b> excessive white space in between sections<br>
            • <b>Combine</b> sections with redundant information<br>
            • <b>Move</b> sections to other pages<br>
            • <b>Add</b> donation buttons towards the top<br>
            • <b>Change</b> images to be more recent and larger resolution<br>
            • <b>Fix</b> the broken buttons and links with guidance from the organization on what they are supposed to do<br>
            <br>
            Next, we looked at issues with the <b>health services page</b>:<br>
            <br>
            • There isn’t much <b>description</b> of specific health services<br>
            • The clinic store hours are very <b>confusing</b><br>
            • There is <b>redundant</b> information<br>
            • There is <b>no information</b> how to get to the physical clinic<br>
            • There are <b>large blocks</b> of text<br>
            <br>
            We came up with some potential <b>solutions</b>:<br>
            <br>
            • <b>Add</b> a description for each specific health service<br>
            • <b>Change</b> the format of the clinic store hours and condense<br>
            • <b>Remove</b> unnecessary sections and text<br>
            • <b>Add</b> directions and address of the physical clinic, and encourage them to go<br>
            • <b>Add</b> more images to break up large blocks of text<br>
            <br>
            Then, we continued with the rest of the pages, and took more notes on issues and solutions. However, we saw the same themes come up time and time again. <br>
            <br>
            First, <b>redundant information</b>: there was significant overlap between pages and sections, which made the website longer and more complex than it needed to be. Second, <b>confusing and unorganized information</b>: formats changed constantly throughout pages and there was little organization or indication on where to find specific information. Third, <b>outdated or incorrect information</b>: images were old, some pages were not updated to the same visual style as the rest, and some buttons and links were not functional. Fourth, <b>not enough call to action</b>: the website’s main purpose was to get clients to take action such as donate or visit their clinic, and there was not much indication of this. <br>
            <br>
            We decided to <b>focus on these four themes throughout the whole website</b>, taking steps to address these big issues that make the website hard to use for clients. <br>
            <br>
            Next, we performed <b>internal A/B testing</b>. Because most of the individual changes at this stage were small, we were able to effectively test them by changing one at a time and comparing results. The majority of the changes were connected to one of the four themes we established earlier, and we measured their success by determining if it made the website <b>clearer, easier to understand, more functional, or better serve their purpose</b>. From this stage, we got a better understanding of what changes worked and what didn’t, and at the end we had a long <b>list of changes</b> to implement in the actual design. <br>
            <br>
            Finally, we had to research the parts of the website that do work, and should <b>not be changed</b> in our redesign. We determined that the <b>color theme</b> of blue and orange was important to keep, because it was essential to their brand identity. Additionally, the <b>detailed text information</b> about their clinic was crucial to keep due to it providing the foundation of the website’s whole purpose, which is to assist clients who go to their physical clinic. Lastly, people are a very important part of the organization's whole mission and purpose; therefore, we needed to keep all the <b>human testimonials</b> and <b>experience descriptions</b>, maintaining the <b>humanitarian</b> side of the website and organization.<br>
        </div>
        <br><br><br>
        <div class = "header" id = "III">III. Wireframes</div>
        <div class = "text">
            <br>
            At this point, we split up the designing work, while still maintaining a consistent style and conferring with each other frequently. I was responsible for the <b>entirety of the home page</b>, which consisted of a significant amount of information and actions. Based on our research and ideation, I decided to split it up into 5 sections:<br>
            <br>
            • The <b>header</b> and <b>main statement</b><br>
            • An <b>overview</b> and <b>description of services</b><br>
            • An <b>impact statement</b><br>
            • A <b>donation call to action</b><br>
            • <b>Helpful links</b> for community members<br>
            <br>
            At this stage, I made wireframes for each of these sections separately, but later I combined them all into the one complete smooth page.<br>
            <br>
            I began with <b>low fidelity wireframes</b>, focusing on content and layout. First was the header and main statement section.<br>
            <br>
            <div class = "imagePlaceholder" style = "padding-top:56%;">
                <img class = "image" src="dcyhc/dcyhc1.png">
            </div>
            <br>
            <span class = "caption">Lo-fi wireframe of the header and main statement section.</span><br>
            <br>
            Based on our previous insights, <b>images</b>, especially of real people, were incredibly important in the website because of the humanitarian nature of the work the organization does. That is why, right at the top of the home page in this section, I included a <b>large image background</b>, which I intended to be a group photo of the clinic patients. Additionally, the donate button being featured here caters to another thought we had; we need <b>more call to action</b>. Finally, the header itself was just one row of links, as compared to the two rows of links the old version had. This makes it much <b>easier to navigate</b> and find information.<br>
            <br>
            Next, the overview and description of services.<br>
            <br>
            <div class = "imagePlaceholder" style = "padding-top:67%;">
                <img class = "image" src="dcyhc/dcyhc2.png">
            </div>
            <br>
            <span class = "caption">Lo-fi wireframe of the overview and description of services section.</span><br>
            <br>
            The general overview and description text provide the <b>foundational information</b> about the clinic itself. In the old version, this was buried much farther down and was less clear. Also, the three box format for the description of services provides <b>quick access</b> to multiple important pieces of information, and <b>utilizes space</b> more efficiently.<br>
            <br>
            Next was the impact statement.<br>
            <br>
            <div class = "imagePlaceholder" style = "padding-top:56%;">
                <img class = "image" src="dcyhc/dcyhc3.png">
            </div>
            <br>
            <span class = "caption">Lo-fi wireframe of the impact statement section.</span><br>
            <br>
            Highlighting the actual number of years the organization has been helping the community, serves to <b>promote their cause</b> and <b>build trust</b> in the potential clients. Upon meeting with the organization, we found out the number was 34, which is impressive and shows the resiliency and effectiveness of the organization. And once again, it features a large image to the side, focusing on the <b>human aspect</b> and not just statistics. <br>
            <br>
            Next, I made the donation call to action section.<br>
            <br>
            <div class = "imagePlaceholder" style = "padding-top:56%;">
                <img class = "image" src="dcyhc/dcyhc4.png">
            </div>
            <br>
            <span class = "caption">Lo-fi wireframe of the donation call to action section.</span><br>
            <br>
            As stated previously, one of our goals was to increase the <b>call to action</b> to turn visitors into beneficiaries for the organization. This is the second donate button on the home page, the first being featured right at the top. Assuming they scrolled past that, this is a stronger reminder of how important the organization’s work is in <b>helping vulnerable youth</b>, and the large image banner further drives the <b>emotional appeal</b>.<br>
            <br>
            Finally, I made the helpful links section.<br>
            <br>
            <div class = "imagePlaceholder" style = "padding-top:56%;">
                <img class = "image" src="dcyhc/dcyhc5.png">
            </div>
            <br>
            <span class = "caption">Lo-fi wireframe of the helpful links section.</span><br>
            <br>
            This section helps provide quick access to <b>useful links for community members</b>, not just clients. It emphasizes the <b>community-serving goal</b> of the organization, and features yet another large image to solidify the human appeal. In the old version, the links were much harder to find, so I focused on making them easy to see.<br>
            <br>
            After I, and the rest of my team who made lo-fi designs for the other pages, went through this process, we moved on to <b>high fidelity wireframing</b>. I did the same set of sections on the home page, working on <b>synthesizing</b> my lo-fi layouts, the solutions we researched earlier, and the existing elements we wanted to keep from the old version. <br>
            <br>
            <div class = "imagePlaceholder" style = "padding-top:64.8%;">
                <img class = "image" src="dcyhc/dcyhc6.png">
            </div>
            <br>
            <span class = "caption">Hi-fi wireframe of the header and main statement section.</span><br>
            <br>
            <div class = "imagePlaceholder" style = "padding-top:75%;">
                <img class = "image" src="dcyhc/dcyhc7.png">
            </div>
            <br>
            <span class = "caption">Hi-fi wireframe of the overview and description of services section.</span><br>
            <br>
            <div class = "imagePlaceholder" style = "padding-top:50.5%;">
                <img class = "image" src="dcyhc/dcyhc8.png">
            </div>
            <br>
            <span class = "caption">Hi-fi wireframe of the impact statement section.</span><br>
            <br>
            <div class = "imagePlaceholder" style = "padding-top:55.5%;">
                <img class = "image" src="dcyhc/dcyhc9.png">
            </div>
            <br>
            <span class = "caption">Hi-fi wireframe of the donation call to action section.</span><br>
            <br>
            <div class = "imagePlaceholder" style = "padding-top:48%;">
                <img class = "image" src="dcyhc/dcyhc10.png">
            </div>
            <br>
            <span class = "caption">Hi-fi wireframe of the helpful links section.</span><br>
            <br>
            Here are some key aspects of these designs:<br>
            <br>
            • The <b>color theme</b> of orange and blue was important to maintain from the original and emphasize, and can be seen throughout these sections<br>
            • The <b>frequent use of images</b> containing real people displays the humanitarian mission of the organization<br>
            • Although the general style is constant, there is <b>variation</b> in the specific format of the different sections to make the page feel more interesting<br>
            • The sections smoothly encapsulate different aspects of the organization and present all the <b>information</b> necessary, but in a <b>simpler</b>, <b>easier to understand</b>, and <b>less redundant</b> format than the old version<br>
        </div>
        <br><br><br>
        <div class = "header" id = "IV">IV. Final Prototype</div>
        <div class = "text">
            <br>
            We combined all of our ideas and designs into the implementation of the <b>final prototype</b>. We worked on editing the organization’s official Squarespace website. <br>
            <br>
            <div class = "imagePlaceholder" style = "padding-top:75%;">
                <img class = "image" src="dcyhc/dcyhc11.png">
            </div>
            <br>
            <span class = "caption">Header and main statement section.</span><br>
            <br>
            <div class = "imagePlaceholder" style = "padding-top:75%;">
                <img class = "image" src="dcyhc/dcyhc12.png">
            </div>
            <br>
            <span class = "caption">Overview and description of services section.</span><br>
            <br>
            <div class = "imagePlaceholder" style = "padding-top:75%;">
                <img class = "image" src="dcyhc/dcyhc13.png">
            </div>
            <br>
            <span class = "caption">Impact statement section.</span><br>
            <br>
            <div class = "imagePlaceholder" style = "padding-top:75%;">
                <img class = "image" src="dcyhc/dcyhc14.png">
            </div>
            <br>
            <span class = "caption">Donation call to action section.</span><br>
            <br>
            <div class = "imagePlaceholder" style = "padding-top:75%;">
                <img class = "image" src="dcyhc/dcyhc15.png">
            </div>
            <br>
            <span class = "caption">Helpful links section.</span><br>
            <br>
            While it is very similar to our hi-fi wireframes, there are a few small differences:<br>
            <br>
            • I made the action buttons orange instead of blue to be more <b>noticeable</b><br>
            • I added blue highlights on orange background boxes throughout to further emphasize the <b>dual theme</b> of blue and orange<br>
            • I changed the format of the 3 services boxes to be more <b>sequential</b><br>
            • The helpful link buttons have black backgrounds to provide more <b>contrast</b><br>
            <br>
            <b>This prototype was published to their official website.</b><br>
        </div>
        <br><br><br>
        <div class = "header">V. Outcomes</div>
        <div class = "text" id = "V">
            <br>
            In the end, we accomplished the <b>three main tasks</b> established at the beginning: <b>research</b> ways to improve the website, <b>redesign</b> a new version based on the solutions, and then <b>implement</b> the changes in their published Squarespace website. <br>
            <br>
            I learned a lot about the <b>power of different appeals through design</b>. We used images of people to highlight the human side, years of impact to emphasize experience and resilience, helpful links to show the community impact of the organization and more. Using these aspects effectively can <b>build an image</b> of the product or organization you are representing through the design, and I got a lot of experience working with these ideas through this project. Additionally, I made significant improvements in my <b>research, ideation, wireframing, designing, and prototyping skills</b>, as well as my ability to use <b>Figma and Squarespace</b>. <br>
            <br>
            Through our work, we were able to assist an organization that helps people, and our design will be seen by many across their community.<br>
