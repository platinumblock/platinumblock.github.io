    <div class = "aboutMe">
      I am currently a 1st year student at the <b>University of California, Berkeley</b>, majoring in <b>Electrical Engineering & Computer Science</b>. Throughout my early years, I did a lot of programming - software engineering, website development, game development, and others. While the engineering medium changed, I always loved the <b>design aspect.</b>
    </div>
    <div class = "aboutMe">
      I am obsessed with <b>user experience</b>. Every time I use an app or website that has a major flaw in design or usability, I am seriously annoyed. I'm <b>motivated</b> to create the smoothest, easiest, most effective user experience for technology possible.
    </div>
    <div class = "aboutMe">
      A lot of people, in many different fields, say they want to make an impact through technology. However, the benefit of all technology comes from it being <b>used effectively</b>. I hope my work enables technology to be used for good, <b>impacting the world</b>.
    </div>
    <div class = "aboutMe">
      I'm experienced in <b>Figma</b> and <b>front-end development</b> (HTML, CSS, JS, React). But I also have skills in <b>user research, synthesis, ideation, and prototyping.</b>
    </div>
    <div class = "aboutMe">
      I am currently a member in two <b>technology consulting clubs</b> at UC Berkeley: <b>UX at Berkeley</b>, and <b>Code For Good</b>. I cherish the experiences and opportunities I've gotten from these groups.
    </div>
    <div class = "aboutMe">
      For fun, I enjoy:<br>
      â€¢ Gaming (I'm iron in Valorant ðŸ’€)<br>
      â€¢ Chess (I'm in Chess Club at Berkeley!)<br>
      â€¢ Biking (I watch the Tour de France every year)<br>
      â€¢ Algorithmic programming (My favorite problems are string manipulation)<br>
      â€¢ Listening to energetic music (Check out my new favorite <a onclick = 'openSong()' style = 'color:var(--darkprimary);text-decoration:underline;cursor:pointer;'>song</a>!)
